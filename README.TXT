Hello my name is Dwight Coles III. I currently have no
group project members, so this project was done by me.
This is a project that reads input from a text file, manilupates the text,
then puts the content into a array list for the user.
The project also checks for errors.


To compile this program:
   - $ make

After compiling, you are now ready to run.

To run the UnsortedListDr file:
   - $ ./UnsortedListDr
